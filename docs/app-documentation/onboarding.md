# User Onboarding Flow

We prioritize a frictionless onboarding experience to maximize participation in the preferencing process.

## Worker Onboarding
1. **Invite**: Manager uploads a worker CSV; workers receive an email with a unique invite link.
2. **Activation**: Worker clicks the link, confirms their identity, and sets up their profile.
3. **Tutorial**: A brief interactive guide explains how to view job lines and rank preferences.
4. **Preferencing**: Worker enters the active allocation window.

## Management Onboarding
1. **Org Setup**: Initial hospital/department profile is created.
2. **Team Configuration**: Defining units, wards, and rotation schedules.
3. **Data Import**: Importing existing job lines and worker lists from legacy systems or spreadsheets.
4. **Verification**: Testing the allocation logic with a sample set of data.
