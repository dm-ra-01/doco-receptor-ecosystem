# Receptor Management Portal

:::danger
This legacy documentation is being subdivided into the **Core Suite Strategy**.
- For organizational master data, see [**Receptor Workforce**](./receptor-workforce).
- For allocation planning and runs, see [**Receptor Planner**](./receptor-planner).
- For worker preference submission, see [**Receptor Preferencer**](./receptor-preferencer).
- For the matching engine, see [**Receptor Allocator**](../allocator-backend/).
:::


The **Management Portal** was the original concept for a unified command center. It is being replaced by specialized apps for better security and workflow isolation.
