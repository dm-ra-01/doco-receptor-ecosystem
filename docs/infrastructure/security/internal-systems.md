# Internal Systems & Technology Stack

While our **Product Stack** (Supabase, Next.js, Flutter) is mature and well-documented, our **Internal Operations Stack** (the tools to run the business) is currently in a "Project" phase.

:::note
**Current Status:** Discovery / Ad-hoc.
**Goal:** Formalize core business systems by April 2026.

## The "Organization Debt" Check
We currently operate without centralized ERP, CRM, or HRIS systems. This is an intentional choice to preserve cash and agility in the early stage, but it incurs "organizational debt" (manual tracking, spreadsheeting) that must be paid down as we scale.

## Gap Analysis & Roadmap

| Function | Current State | Target Solution (Draft) | Trigger to Implement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financials** | Manual Invoicing / Spreadsheets | **Xero / MYOB** | First recurring revenue or >5 active contracts. |
| **CRM (Sales)** | Personal Networks / Email | **HubSpot / Pipedrive** | When lead volume exceeds simple memory/spreadsheet tracking. |
| **HRIS (People)** | Standard Contracts | **Employment Hero** | Employee #4 or first full-time hire outside founders. |
| **Project Mgmt** | GitHub Issues | **Linear / Jira** | When engineering velocity requires strict burn-down tracking. |

## Immediate Projects
*   [ ] **Finance:** Select and configure a basic accounting package for tax compliance.
*   [ ] **Documentation:** Continue expanding this Docusaurus instance as the "Brain" of the company.
