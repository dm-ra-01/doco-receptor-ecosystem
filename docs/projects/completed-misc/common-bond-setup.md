# Common Bond: The First 30 Days Roadmap

**Now that your ACN is active and your Trust ABN is reactivating, use this checklist to ensure your infrastructure matches the "Doctor-Developer" quality described in your business plan.**

This roadmap is designed to move Common Bond from a legal entity to an operational vehicle capable of supporting the "Receptor" platform deployment.

---

## 1. Financial & Tax Foundation
*Establishing the "Shared Bond" of financial integrity.*

- [ ] **Open the Trust Bank Account**: Visit your bank with the Original 2022 Deed and the 2026 Appointment Deed. Account name should be: *Common Bond Pty Ltd ATF The Ammendolea Family Trust*.
- [ ] **Set up Accounting Software**: Register for Xero or QuickBooks. Link your Trust bank feed. This is where you will manage your GST obligations and track "Receptor" R&D costs.
- [ ] **Initial Capital Injection**: Deposit the $1.00 "Initial Sum" from the Settlor and your own seed capital into the Trust account to officially "fund" the business.
- [ ] **Tax Professional Alignment**: Discuss with your accountant the requirement for a "Bucket Company" (Optional for later) to hold profits that you don't want to distribute to individuals this year.

---

## 2. IP & Governance (The Firewall)
*Protecting the intellectual core of the "Doctor-Developer" advantage.*

- [ ] **Execute the IP License Agreement**: Sign a formal document where *MyJMO Pty Ltd* licenses the "Receptor" software to the *Ammendolea Family Trust*.
- [ ] **Register the Domain**: Secure `commonbond.com.au` or similar. Ensure it is owned by the Trust.
- [ ] **Professional Service Agreement (PSA)**: Draft your standard consulting contract. As an agile consultancy, ensure your PSA has clear "Out of Scope" clauses to prevent the "Feature Creep" mentioned in your [SWOT Analysis](https://docs.commonbond.au/corporate/docs/business-planning/strategy-vision/swot).
- [ ] **SaaS Terms of Service (ToS)**: Draft the user agreement for Receptor. Crucially, include a **Data Sovereignty Clause** stating all medical workforce data is stored strictly in Australia.

---

## 3. Risk & Insurance (Medical Sector Compliance)
*De-risking the existential threats to a niche health-tech vendor.*

<MatrixGrid columns={2}>
  <FrameworkCard title="Professional Indemnity (PI)" icon="🛡️">
    <strong>Non-negotiable.</strong> Ensure the policy covers "Algorithmic Advice" or "Software Errors" given the nature of Receptor's matching engine.
  </FrameworkCard>
  <FrameworkCard title="Cyber & Data Breach" icon="🔒">
    <strong>High Priority.</strong> Since you handle JMO placement data, a breach is the biggest existential threat. Cybersecurity is part of our "Clinical Empathy."
  </FrameworkCard>
  <FrameworkCard title="Public Liability (PL)" icon="🏢">
    Standard requirement for entering hospital premises or LHNs for workshops and Constraint Mapping sessions.
  </FrameworkCard>
  <FrameworkCard title="WorkSafe Victoria" icon="📑">
    Legal requirement in Victoria once you start paying yourself a salary, even as a sole director.
  </FrameworkCard>
</MatrixGrid>

## 4. Technical Infrastructure (The "Receptor" Build)
*Translating SQL to SOP with enterprise-grade reliability.*

- [ ] **Secure Cloud Hosting**: Set up an AWS or Azure account in the name of the Trust. Use Australian regions (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`) to satisfy health department data requirements.
- [ ] **Zero-Trust Implementation**: As per your [Operational Strategy](https://docs.commonbond.au/corporate/docs/business-planning/operations/eos/processes), implement MFA across all business tools (Email, GitLab, AWS, Xero).
- [ ] **The "Audit Trail" Engine**: Finalize the logging logic for Receptor. Your value proposition is "The Receipt of Fairness"—ensure your database can prove why a match happened if a JMO disputes it.
- [ ] **Sales CRM**: Set up a simple CRM (like Pipedrive or a Notion database) to track your "Phase 1" leads in Melbourne Metro (Monash Health, etc.).

---

## 5. Brand & Marketing
*Projecting the authority of a physician-led consultancy.*

- [ ] **Update LinkedIn**: Transition your profile to "Founder & Principal Consultant at Common Bond." Reference the [Founder Bio](https://docs.commonbond.au/corporate/docs/business-planning/strategy-vision/founder) for tactical messaging.
- [ ] **Capability Statement**: Create a high-quality PDF summarizing the **Doctor-Developer Advantage**. This is your "leave-behind" after meetings with Medical Workforce Managers.
- [ ] **The "Audit" Hook**: Prepare the template for your **"Free Allocation Stress Test"** to use as a lead magnet for [Market Expansion](https://docs.commonbond.au/corporate/docs/business-planning/market-sales/marketing-strategy).
